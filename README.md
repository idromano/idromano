#### Olá!

I'm **Ícaro Romano** :)

I used Python to **automate** part of my job and became up to 4 times faster.

I made bots that **crawl** and **scrape**, but I've also participated in public **data analysis** using Python by the Instituto HUB and UFRJ.
Bachelor of Arts (**Linguistics**, Portuguese, French) from the same university, experienced in technical **translation** & book publishing.

Going further, I also study **Urban Mobility**:
> [**What if all streets had a type of cycle path?**](https://github.com/idromano/autotegast "repository")

I also write on the Youtube channel **Balaclava TV**.
