# Olá!

I'm **Ícaro Romano** :)

I'm a Python and Bubble developer from Rio, Brazil. 🇧🇷

### I mostly do:

• MPVs using Bubble. This is my study project: [Linha & Papel](https://linhaepapel.bubbleapps.io/version-test/) — I think it's going well :)

• Bots that **crawl** and **scrape**. I used Python to **automate** part of my job in support, I became up to 4 times faster and improved my QA score!

• Invested in **Urban Mobility**:

• I've also participated in events **data analysis** using public data and Python events by the Instituto HUB and UFRJ.

• I have a Bachelor of Arts (**Linguistics**, Portuguese, French) from the same university, experienced in technical **translation** & book publishing, and write on the Youtube channel [**Balaclava TV**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRn-wg2HBYnSPf62et1d9w) (_"Isabela Boscov analisa linguagens de programação"_).
